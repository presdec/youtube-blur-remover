Hey YouTube enthusiasts! 👋

I created the **YouTube Blur Remover** extension to solve a problem that was driving me (and many others) crazy - YouTube's new animated blur effects and ambient glow around videos. These effects can be distracting and make videos harder to focus on.

✨ **Eliminates ambient glow** and mood lighting
✨ **Works in all viewing modes** - normal, theater, fullscreen
✨ **Lightweight & fast** - no performance impact
